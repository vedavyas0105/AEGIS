Visual Hallucinations,R44.1,"The clinical text directly states ""visual hallucinations,"" making R44.1 the most accurate and specific code.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly describes ""visual hallucinations,"" and the code R44.1 directly matches this clinical presentation."
Dysphagia,R13.1,"The clinical text directly states ""dysphagia,"" making R13.1 the most accurate and specific code.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""dysphagia,"" and R13.1 is the direct code for this condition."
Left hip pain,M25.552,"The clinical text explicitly states ""left hip pain,"" making M25.552 the most accurate and specific code.",Very High,I am very confident because the code directly matches the clinical context of left hip pain.
Shortness of breath,R06.02,"The clinical text directly states ""shortness of breath,"" making R06.02 the most accurate and specific code.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""shortness of breath,"" which is directly represented by the code R06.02."
Fatigue,R53.83,"In the absence of additional information, the most appropriate code for the symptom of fatigue is R53.83 (""Other fatigue"").",High,I am confident because the clinical text explicitly describes fatigue and there is no additional diagnostic information to suggest an underlying condition.
Anemia,D64.9,"In the absence of further information, the most appropriate code for ""anemia"" is D64.9, ""Anemia, unspecified.""",High,"I am confident because the clinical text simply states ""anemia,"" and D64.9 is the direct match for unspecified anemia."
Dyspnea on exertion,R06.09,"In the absence of further information, the most specific code for dyspnea on exertion is R06.09.",High,"I am confident because the clinical text explicitly describes ""dyspnea on exertion"" and there is no additional diagnostic information to suggest an underlying condition."
Bladder Cancer,C67.9,"The clinical text directly states ""bladder cancer,"" making C67.9 the most appropriate code as it represents an unspecified malignant neoplasm of the bladder.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""bladder cancer,"" which directly corresponds to the code C67.9."
Dyspnea on Exertion,R06.09,"In the absence of an underlying diagnosis, R06.09 is the most accurate code for dyspnea on exertion as it is more specific than R06.02.",High,"I am confident because the clinical text explicitly describes ""dyspnea on exertion"" and there is no additional diagnostic information to suggest an underlying condition. The code R06.09 directly matches the clinical presentation for ""dyspnea on exertion."""
Abdominal pain,R10.9,"In the absence of any further information, the most appropriate code for ""abdominal pain"" is R10.9, which represents unspecified abdominal pain.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text simply states ""abdominal pain"" without any additional details, making R10.9 the direct and most accurate match."
