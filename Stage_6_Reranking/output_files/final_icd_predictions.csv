resistant hypertension,I10,"While ""resistant hypertension"" implies the hypertension is not responding to treatment, it is still a form of essential hypertension, making I10 the most appropriate code.",High,"I am confident because ""resistant hypertension"" is still a type of essential hypertension, and I10 is the correct code for this condition."
irritable bowel syndrome,K58.9,"The clinical text directly states ""Irritable bowel syndrome,"" which is accurately represented by code K58.9.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""Irritable bowel syndrome"" and the code K58.9 directly matches this diagnosis."
adult hydrocephalus,G91.9,"The clinical text directly states ""Adult hydrocephalus,"" and G91.9, ""Hydrocephalus, unspecified,"" is the most appropriate code in the absence of further specification.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""Adult hydrocephalus,"" and the code G91.9 directly matches this diagnosis without any ambiguity."
gait impairment,R26.9,"In the absence of further information, the most appropriate code is the one that describes unspecified abnormalities of gait and mobility.",High,"I am confident because the clinical text only states ""gait impairment"" without any additional details, making R26.9 the most accurate and direct match."
urinary incontinence,R32,"The clinical text directly states ""urinary incontinence"" without any further specification, making R32 the most appropriate code.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""urinary incontinence"" and the code R32 directly matches this condition."
urinary urgency,R39.15,"The clinical text describes ""urgency"" without any further information, making R39.15 the most appropriate code as it directly addresses the symptom of urinary urgency.",High,"I am confident because the clinical text explicitly mentions ""urgency,"" and R39.15 is the most direct match for this symptom in the absence of additional information suggesting an underlying condition or type of incontinence."
cognitive impairment,R41.84,"Given the limited information and lack of specified etiology, R41.84, ""Other specified cognitive deficit,"" is the most appropriate code as it captures the cognitive impairment without assigning a specific diagnosis like dementia or Alzheimer's.",High,"I am highly confident because the clinical text only states ""cognitive impairment,"" and R41.84 is the most accurate code for this unspecified cognitive deficit, avoiding assumptions about the underlying cause or severity."
alcohol use disorder,F10.90,"Without further information to specify dependence or an alcohol-induced disorder, the best code is F10.90, which captures the unspecified alcohol use disorder in an uncomplicated state.",High,"I am confident because the clinical text states ""alcohol use disorder"" without specifying dependence or any alcohol-induced disorders, making F10.90 the most accurate and appropriate code."
hypertension,I10,"In the absence of additional information, I10, ""Essential (primary) hypertension,"" is the most appropriate code for a diagnosis of hypertension.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""Hypertension,"" and I10 directly corresponds to essential (primary) hypertension, which is the default classification when the type is not specified."
screening for sexually transmitted disease,Z11.3,"The clinical text explicitly states ""screening for sexually transmitted disease,"" making Z11.3 the most accurate code as it directly addresses encounters for screening of sexually transmitted infections.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text directly matches the code description for Z11.3, indicating a screening encounter for sexually transmitted infections."
rheumatoid arthritis,M06.9,"The clinical text directly states ""Rheumatoid arthritis,"" making M06.9 the most accurate and specific code.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, which is directly represented by the code M06.9."
