Shortness of breath,R06.02,"In the absence of additional information, the best code to represent ""increasing SOB"" is R06.02, ""Shortness of breath.""",High,"I am confident because the clinical text directly states ""increasing SOB,"" which is accurately represented by the code R06.02."
Fatigue,R53.83,"In the absence of additional information, the most appropriate code for the symptom of fatigue is R53.83 (""Other fatigue"").",High,I am confident because the clinical text explicitly describes fatigue and there is no additional diagnostic information to suggest an underlying condition.
Mild chest discomfort,R07.9,"In the absence of further information or a confirmed diagnosis of angina, the more general code for chest pain is the most appropriate choice.",High,"I am confident because the clinical text only mentions ""mild chest discomfort"" without any indication of angina or other specific cardiac conditions, making R07.9 the most accurate and suitable code."
Dizziness,R42,"The clinical text describes ""dizziness,"" which is directly represented by code R42, ""Dizziness and giddiness.""",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""dizziness,"" and the code R42 directly matches this condition."
Elevated blood pressure,I10,"Given the consistently high home BP readings, the most appropriate code is I10, representing essential (primary) hypertension, as it directly addresses the condition of elevated blood pressure without specifying a secondary cause.",High,"I am highly confident because the clinical text indicates consistently high blood pressure readings, which aligns well with the diagnosis of essential hypertension represented by code I10."
Poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,E11.9,"Since the clinical text indicates ""poorly controlled"" Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, it implies that the diabetes is not well-managed, but it doesn't specify any particular complications, making E11.9 the most appropriate code.",High,"I am confident because the clinical text explicitly mentions ""poorly controlled T2DM,"" and E11.9 accurately reflects Type 2 diabetes mellitus without specifying any complications, which aligns with the available information."
History of Hypertension,I10,"The clinical text ""HTN"" directly translates to hypertension, and I10 is the appropriate code for essential (primary) hypertension.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text provides a direct abbreviation for hypertension, and I10 is the correct code for this condition."
Elevated blood pressure,I10,"In the absence of further information or an established diagnosis of hypertension, I10 is the most appropriate code to represent elevated blood pressure.",Medium,"I am moderately confident because the clinical text only indicates an elevated blood pressure reading, and I10 is the default code for essential hypertension, but a more specific diagnosis or further evaluation might be needed to confirm the type of hypertension."
Mild basal crepitations,R09.89,"Given the symptom of mild basal crepitations, the most appropriate code is R09.89, as it encompasses other specified symptoms and signs involving the respiratory system.",High,"I am confident because the clinical text describes a respiratory symptom, and R09.89 is the most specific code available that aligns with the presented information."
Non-specific ST-T changes on ECG,R00.0,"The clinical text describes nonspecific ST-T changes on ECG, which does not directly correspond to any of the provided codes, but given the options, R00.0 (Tachycardia, unspecified) is the closest as ST-T changes can sometimes be associated with heart rate abnormalities.",Low,"I am not confident because the clinical text describes nonspecific ST-T changes, which is not the same as tachycardia, but given the limited options, R00.0 is the closest, though not ideal."
Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) considered,I24.9,"Given that the clinical text indicates a ""working diagnosis"" of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is being considered, but does not confirm a myocardial infarction, the more appropriate code is I24.9, which represents acute ischemic heart disease, unspecified, as it encompasses a broader range of ACS presentations before a definitive diagnosis of MI is established.",High,"I am highly confident because the clinical text suggests ACS is being considered, but doesn't confirm a myocardial infarction, making I24.9 the best fit as it represents acute ischemic heart disease, which aligns with the initial consideration of ACS before a definitive diagnosis."
