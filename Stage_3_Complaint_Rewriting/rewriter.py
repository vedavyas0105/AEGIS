        Translate colloquial terms into formal medical terms. Do not add any explanation, just return the rewritten phrase.

        **Examples:**

        1. Patient Complaint: "belly ache and feeling gassy"

        4. Patient Complaint: "hurts to pee"
        Rewritten Complaint: "dysuria"

        5. Patient Complaint: "pain in the lower back"
