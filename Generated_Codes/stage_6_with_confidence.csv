Visual Hallucinations,R44.1,"The clinical text directly states ""visual hallucinations,"" making R44.1 the most accurate and specific code.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly describes ""visual hallucinations,"" and the code R44.1 directly matches this clinical presentation."
Dysphagia,R13.1,"The clinical text directly states ""dysphagia,"" making R13.1 the most accurate and specific code.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""dysphagia,"" and R13.1 is the direct code for this condition."
Left hip pain,M25.552,"The clinical text explicitly states ""left hip pain,"" making M25.552 the most accurate and specific code.",Very High,I am very confident because the code directly matches the clinical context of left hip pain.
Shortness of breath,R06.02,"The clinical text directly states ""shortness of breath,"" making R06.02 the most accurate and specific code.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""shortness of breath,"" which is directly represented by the code R06.02."
Fatigue,R53.83,"In the absence of additional information, the most appropriate code for the symptom of fatigue is R53.83 (""Other fatigue"").",High,I am confident because the clinical text explicitly describes fatigue and there is no additional diagnostic information to suggest an underlying condition.
Anemia,D64.9,"In the absence of further information, the most appropriate code for ""anemia"" is D64.9, ""Anemia, unspecified.""",High,"I am confident because the clinical text simply states ""anemia,"" and D64.9 is the direct match for unspecified anemia."
Dyspnea on exertion,R06.09,"In the absence of further information, the most specific code for dyspnea on exertion is R06.09.",High,"I am confident because the clinical text explicitly describes ""dyspnea on exertion"" and there is no additional diagnostic information to suggest an underlying condition."
Bladder Cancer,C67.9,"The clinical text directly states ""bladder cancer,"" making C67.9 the most appropriate code as it represents an unspecified malignant neoplasm of the bladder.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""bladder cancer,"" which directly corresponds to the code C67.9."
Abdominal pain,R10.9,"In the absence of any further information, the most appropriate code for ""abdominal pain"" is R10.9, which represents unspecified abdominal pain.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text simply states ""abdominal pain"" without any additional details, making R10.9 the direct and most accurate match."
Abdominal distention,R14.0,"Given the chief complaint and clinical text ""distention,"" R14.0, which directly describes abdominal distension, is the most accurate choice.",High,"I am confident because the clinical text directly mentions ""distention,"" and R14.0 is the most specific code available for abdominal distension."
Nausea,R11.0,"The clinical text directly states ""nausea,"" making R11.0 the most accurate and appropriate code.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""nausea,"" which is directly represented by the code R11.0."
Fever,R50.9,"In the absence of any further information, the best code to describe the patient's fever is R50.9.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""fevers"" and the code R50.9 directly matches this clinical presentation."
Chills,R68.83,"The clinical text directly states ""chills,"" and the candidate code R68.83, ""Chills (without fever),"" is the most accurate and specific match.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""chills,"" and the code R68.83 directly matches this clinical presentation."
fever,R50.9,"In the absence of additional information, the best code to represent the symptom of ""fevers"" is R50.9.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""fevers"" and the code R50.9 directly matches this symptom."
lethargy,R53.83,"In the absence of additional information, R53.83, ""Other fatigue,"" is the most appropriate code to describe lethargy.",Medium,"I am moderately confident because ""lethargy"" can be considered a form of fatigue, but without further context, it's difficult to determine if there's a more specific underlying condition."
bloody drain output,R58,"Given the limited information and the absence of a specific diagnosis, the best code to represent ""bloody drain output"" is R58, Hemorrhage, not elsewhere classified, as it directly addresses the presence of bleeding without specifying the source or cause.",Medium,"I am moderately confident because while R58 is the most appropriate code given the limited information, the lack of context regarding the source and nature of the bloody drain output introduces some uncertainty."
hematuria,R31.9,"In the absence of additional information, the best code to represent hematuria is R31.9.",High,"I am confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""hematuria"" and there is no additional information to suggest a more specific diagnosis."
weakness,R53.83,"Given the limited information of ""weakness"" without further context, R53.83 (Other fatigue) is the most appropriate code as it broadly captures the symptom of weakness or fatigue when no specific cause is identified.",Low,"I am not confident because the clinical text provides minimal information, and the code R53.83 is a general code for fatigue, making it a less precise choice."
slurred speech,R47.1,"Given the isolated symptom of ""slurred speech"" without further context, R47.1 (Dysarthria and anarthria) is the most appropriate code as it directly addresses speech articulation difficulties.",High,"I am highly confident because R47.1 directly describes the condition of slurred speech, and there is no additional information to suggest a more specific underlying cause."
shortness of breath,R06.02,"In the absence of additional information, the code R06.02 directly matches the reported symptom of shortness of breath.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""shortness of breath,"" and the code R06.02 directly corresponds to this symptom."
anemia,D64.9,"In the absence of further information, the most appropriate code for ""anemia"" is D64.9, ""Anemia, unspecified.""",High,"I am confident because the clinical text simply states ""anemia,"" and D64.9 is the direct match for anemia when no further details are provided."
melena,K92.1,"The clinical text directly states ""melena,"" and K92.1 is the only code that directly corresponds to this condition.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""melena,"" and the code K92.1 directly matches this condition."
cough,R05,"The clinical text simply states ""cough,"" and R05 directly corresponds to this symptom.",Very High,"I am very confident because the clinical text explicitly states ""cough,"" and the code R05 directly matches this symptom."
dyspnea,R06.00,"In the absence of additional information, the most accurate code for ""dyspnea"" is R06.00, Dyspnea, unspecified.",High,"I am confident because the clinical text simply states ""dyspnea"" without any further details, making R06.00 the most appropriate and direct match."
